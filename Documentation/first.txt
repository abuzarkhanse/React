React: IS a library tha we are fredom from there standurds
    Some are called them A framwork.

I start today to learn this Langauage Library / FrameWork from Hitash have Youtube chennal:

    Chai Our Code!

SO Let's Start: 07 / 02 / 2025

On terminal:

npx: Node Package Execute 
npm: Node Package Manager: Installer to install there language softwares

Creat-React-App: A utility or software to make a new project.

Instead of creat-react-app we can use vite which is and better then creat-react-app
mean create there may be download some extra filess while in vite
there s download only neccessary file related to our prjects.

Mthods for Bothe:
01:

> project-folder > open terminal > type > npx create-react-app [project-name] > wait for downloading...

After download completion > navigate to your project folder
cd [project-name]

Then > npm run start 

Your project is live Now!


02:

npm create vite
then yes!

> There will be appear that update you profile name instead of vite...somthing...
> After this there will be shwn list of framewor > chose > React
> Then List of variant > chose > JavaScript

DONE! Project is Ready Fast as compare npx create-react-app

But wait there is one thing remaining that is no node-modules folder so install it:

navigate to vite project by cd > then type in ternminal > npm I

Now Done!!! and Complete!! Happy NOW! :)

For starting the projec just type on terminal > npm run dev
