LECTURE 01:

Interesting thing about JS:
"JavaScript is dynamically typed Lamguage"

Like other programming lan where we must write the spacific type for the variable

for example in int is for number string is string type etc.

But JS we can create a different type like we can strore 
Number is type = FullName;

> FullName = 25;
> a = null;
> can give a name for a variables its own.
> Bust case sensitive for example Lower and Capital case naming.
