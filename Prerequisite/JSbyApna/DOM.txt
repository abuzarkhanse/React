DOM: Document Object Model
> When a web page loaded the browser creates a DOM of the page.

> HTML we write can access through access inside JS because they are convert to an Object.

> To print our object we use console.dir();

> console.log() is for general print in console.

With in object there is another object:
> Document: Model and representation of our html code.

Window ==> Document ==> HTML ==> Head ==> meta, title, link
                             ==> Body ==> div, javascrip


When we need to change in html file dynamicaly we use DOM but change that are occuring by user called dynamically.

DOM manipulation:
> changees inside DOM


First we start accessing to element:
01: Selecting with ID: # by giving id to the element

02: Selecting with Class: . by giving them class name.

03: Selecting with tag name: have no class and id but simple tag such as <input> or <button>
Next Level:
04: Query Selector: Pass all the elements like when we need all the para tag or all the element match with provide tag in querySelector("").


When we have no id in html so they give (null) output
and when have no class they give (empty html collection)
